# Book Skill — DEVPLAN

Tooling milestones for the `/book` skill. Project-content milestones live in each book project's own DEVPLAN.

---

## Phase 1 — PDF Export (2026-04-29) — DONE

`/book pdf <book> [chNN]` — render Markdown chapters to a book-quality PDF via WeasyPrint + python-markdown. Single-chapter and whole-book modes. Output → `chapters/<book>/pdf/`.

- [x] M1: `scripts/build_pdf.py` + `scripts/book.css` (A5, Georgia 11pt, drop-cap, scene-break ornament `* * *`, page numbers, title page for whole-book mode).
- [x] M2: `instructions/pdf.md` dispatcher instruction.
- [x] M3: SKILL.md commands-table row + routing (`pdf → instructions/pdf.md`).
- [x] M4: project-side `.gitignore` of `chapters/*/pdf/` (applied to the consuming project, not the skill repo).
- [x] M5: smoke test — book-1 ch01 (43K) + book-1 whole (81K with title page) generated cleanly.

---

## Phase 2 — EPUB Export (2026-04-29) — DONE

`/book epub <book> [chNN]` — mirror of `/book pdf` for the digital Kindle pipeline. Engine: `ebooklib` (pure-Python, MIT, no native deps). Output → `chapters/<book>/epub/`. Optional `chapters/<book>/meta.yaml` overrides title/author/identifier/language; defaults: title from `outline.md`, author "Unknown Author", deterministic UUID, lang "en".

- [x] M1: `scripts/build_epub.py` + `scripts/epub.css` (reflow-friendly em-based, no page-sizes, drop-cap, `* * *` scene break).
- [x] M2: `instructions/epub.md`.
- [x] M3: SKILL.md commands-table row + routing.
- [x] M4: smoke test — **closed by Phase 5 M5/M6 (2026-05-01)**. uv self-bootstrap resolved the PEP 668 issue; smoke test surfaced two pre-existing bugs (empty EpubNav content, chapter content set as str instead of bytes), both fixed in Phase 5 M6. EPUBs now valid in both single-chapter and whole-book modes.

---

## Phase 3 — Writer Guardrails + Smell-Test Layer (2026-04-29) — IN PROGRESS (IDD fallback)

> **Execution mode:** IDD, not TDD. Phase 3 deliverables are markdown LLM-instruction files (`sniff.md`, edits to `chapter-writer.md` / `coherence-check.md` / `revise.md` / `SKILL.md`). The skill repo has no test runner, and grep-tests for markdown content would be cargo-cult TDD (the "test" would be a near-duplicate of the content being written). Per `~/.claude/skills/devplan/TDD.md` §1, falling back to IDD for these milestones with the reasoning logged here.

Surfaced from analysis of the first written Ch.01 (ground-truth project). The chapter exposed a class of recurring failure: the writer agent fills worldbuilding silence with **plausible-but-uncanonicalized invention** (€2/kg sardines in 2045 Marseille; "filtration alert tier two" with no canonical tier system; "drone corridor 042" with no schema; "beat off by 0.3" technobabble). Coherence-check catches internal contradictions. Reviewer catches craft. Proofreader catches surface. **Nothing in the current pipeline catches "would a skeptical, informed reader call BS on this?"** — what we're calling the *smell test*.

This phase adds three layers:

1. **A new `/book sniff` subcommand** — adversarial skeptical-reader pass producing `SMELL.md` with three classifications: INLINE (revise can fix), ANCHOR-NEEDED (worldbuilding gap; surface to project DEVPLAN), ACCEPT (deliberate, signoff).
2. **Hardened `chapter-writer.md` rules** — pre-drafting checks that prevent the most common invention patterns (economic, system-implying numbers, unearned capabilities, interior labeling, undocumented outline cuts).
3. **Hardened `coherence-check.md`** — BLOCKING / WARNING / NOTE flags for the same classes the sniff pass catches, run in the routine coherence flow.

Phase 3 does not implement project-content milestones — those are filed in each book project's DEVPLAN as anchor-fill milestones surfaced by the sniff output.

### M1: New `instructions/sniff.md` — adversarial skeptical-reader pass ✅

**File:** `instructions/sniff.md` (NEW).

- [x] Define usage: `/book sniff <book> [chNN]`. Reads the latest draft of the chapter (or the most recent if no chapter specified), produces `chapters/<book>/SMELL.md`.
- [x] Specify the reader persona for the executing agent: *informed, skeptical, well-read, not romantic about the work*. Looks for things that would make a reader pause and call BS.
- [x] Nine objection categories the agent must scan for, line by line:
  1. **Anachronism** — does the assertion track with 21 years of climate / tech / society evolution from 2024 baseline?
  2. **Worldbuilding-canon contradiction** — direct conflict with `world/` or `characters/` files?
  3. **Technobabble without referent** — specific number/term ("0.3", "tier two", "corridor 042") implies a system; does that system exist in canon?
  4. **Unearned capability or knowledge** — character/object/agent does/knows something not previously established.
  5. **Domain plausibility** — would an economist, engineer, doctor, person with disability, or local (Marseillais, etc.) call BS?
  6. **Physical implausibility** — geometry, physics, biology of described action.
  7. **Character behavior** — consistent with established sheet?
  8. **Plot armor / convenience** — events resolve too easily; info appears when needed.
  9. **Continuity within chapter** — timeline, geography, props consistent across the chapter itself (e.g., object in pocket → in hand without transition).
- [x] Output format: `SMELL.md` with one entry per objection. Each entry:
  - **File:line** (or scene reference)
  - **Quote** (the offending passage)
  - **Objection category** (one of the 9 above)
  - **What the reader would think**
  - **Classification:** INLINE / ANCHOR-NEEDED / ACCEPT
  - **Suggested action:**
    - INLINE → proposed prose fix.
    - ANCHOR-NEEDED → which worldbuilding file needs a section, what the section must define, suggested milestone language for the project DEVPLAN.
    - ACCEPT → why deliberate (only if the writer agent has documented evidence in the outline or world files).
- [x] Write a short calibration note: the agent must err toward *more* objections, not fewer. False positives are cheap (the user dismisses); false negatives let bad prose ship.
- [x] After producing `SMELL.md`, the skill prints a one-line summary: `wrote SMELL.md — N objections (X INLINE, Y ANCHOR-NEEDED, Z ACCEPT)`.

### M2: Wire the dispatcher ✅

**File:** `SKILL.md` (REVISIONE).

- [x] Commands-table row: `| sniff <book> [ch] | Adversarial skeptical-reader pass → SMELL.md | /book sniff book-1 ch01 |`.
- [x] Routing list: `sniff → instructions/sniff.md`.
- [x] `## The Pipeline` section: insert sniff between write and review:
  ```
  WRITING LOOP (repeat per batch)
    6. /book write book-1        → write 5 chapters
    7. /book sniff book-1        → adversarial skeptical-reader → SMELL.md
    8. /book review book-1       → editorial review → REVIEW.md
    9. /book proofread book-1    → line-level review → PROOFREAD.md
   10. /book revise book-1       → apply SMELL + REVIEW + PROOFREAD fixes to prose
  ```

### M3: Extend `instructions/revise.md` to consume SMELL.md INLINE items ✅

**File:** `instructions/revise.md` (REVISIONE).

- [x] Add SMELL.md to the load list.
- [x] Apply INLINE entries (proposed prose fixes from the sniff pass) BEFORE editorial/proof fixes — gaffes cleared first, craft after.
- [x] ANCHOR-NEEDED entries are NOT applied; instead, surface them in the revise summary as "deferred to worldbuilding (see SMELL.md ANCHOR-NEEDED block)" and stop there. They become input to the project's DEVPLAN.
- [x] ACCEPT entries are noted in the summary but not acted on.

### M4: Harden `instructions/chapter-writer.md` — pre-drafting `MUST` rules ✅

**File:** `instructions/chapter-writer.md` (REVISIONE — add a new Pre-Drafting Anchor Checks section).

- [x] **4a — Level-aware economic-anchor pre-check.** Before drafting any scene with a *price, wage, cost, balance, salary, rent, fee, fine, tip, ration, memory-credit transaction, kilo+price pairing, monetary unit (€/euros/CBDC/GPU-HE) near digits, allocation request, compliance-score gating*, the agent MUST read the level-appropriate anchor file (Reality → `economy.md §Consumer Anchors`; Ark → `daily-life.md §Economy`; Dome → `bureaucracy.md §Allocation Mathematics`) and pick a value consistent with it. If no anchor exists, STOP and request a worldbuilding-anchor milestone before drafting.
- [x] **4b — Broader no-invent rule** (system-implying details). For any *tier system, score, hum frequency in Hz, MHz, latency / bandwidth / corridor / channel number, % offer / discount, compliance threshold, hardware-vintage capability claim*, the agent MUST verify a canonical worldbuilding anchor exists. If absent, STOP. The trigger keyword set is explicit (no fuzzy matching): `tier`, `score`, `Hz`, `MHz`, `% offer`, `compliance check`, `corridor 0\d\d`, `latency`, `bandwidth`, `LED`, `firmware`, `handshake`, `signature`.
- [x] **4c — Show-don't-tell hard rule with forbidden formulas.** The following constructions are FORBIDDEN as interior labeling and may only appear when they describe an EXTERIOR observation:
  - `the closest thing to <emotion> he/she had had in days/weeks/years`
  - `a kind of <abstract noun>`
  - `almost <verb>` / `almost felt like`
  - `started to <verb>` ... `before/and stopped` (when used as interior gesture-labeling rather than exterior fact)
  - `<character> felt X` followed by an explanation of what X is
  Express interior states through physical action, gesture, or sensory tightening. The agent reviews its own draft for these patterns at self-edit and rewrites or deletes.
- [x] **4d — Outline-to-chapter coverage contract.** If the writer cuts, splits, or reorders outlined scenes during drafting, it MUST: (i) update `chapters/book-N/outline.md` to reflect the new split (move plant tags, update beat-section structure); (ii) write a one-line entry to `chapters/book-N/outline-deviation.md` (NEW file, append-only): `Ch.NN: <scene> moved/cut/merged because <reason>. Plants shifted: <list>.`; (iii) flag any plants that lost their planned chapter so the next write call surfaces them. No silent cuts.

### M5: Harden `instructions/coherence-check.md` — six new check classes ✅

**File:** `instructions/coherence-check.md` (REVISIONE).

- [x] **5a — Economic-anchor BLOCKING** (level-aware) — implemented as check class **L**. For every chapter draft, scan for monetary/transactional/allocation details (regex set: `€\d`, `\beuros?\b`, `\bCBDC\b` near digits, `\bGPU-HE\b` near digits, `\bkilo\b`/`\b/kg\b` in price context, `\bbalance\b` near numeric, `\bration\b` near numeric, `\bcompliance score\b`, `\bmemory credit\b`, `\benzyme cloth\b` near numeric, `W-RAR-03`). Verify each match traces to the level-appropriate anchor file. Unanchored or contradictory → BLOCKING.
- [x] **5b — System-implying-number BLOCKING** — implemented as check class **M**. Same regex strategy on the trigger set from M4b above (`tier <digit>`, `corridor 0\d\d`, `<digit> Hz` outside canonical anchors, `% offer`, etc.). Each match must trace to canon. BLOCKING if not.
- [x] **5c — Interior-labeling NOTE** (soft) — implemented as check class **N**. Scan for the M4c forbidden formulas. Each match → NOTE-level flag with the line and a suggested rewrite. NOT BLOCKING — these are advisory.
- [x] **5d — Outline-to-draft coverage WARNING** — implemented as check class **O**. For every scene listed in the relevant outline, verify a corresponding section exists in the draft (heuristic: scene's distinctive props/characters appear in the draft text). Missing scenes → WARNING with cross-ref to `outline-deviation.md`. Missing AND no entry in `outline-deviation.md` → BLOCKING (the writer cut without documenting).
- [x] **5e — Cross-substrate sensory-echo WARNING** — implemented as check class **P**. Maintain a registry of canonical sensory anchors (e.g., 440 Hz hum in Ark per Phase 111 M3). For every chapter draft, when a sensory detail matches a number/object already canonical at a *different* level, flag WARNING: "this echo is intentional (cross-substrate plant) or accident (collision)? confirm in `temporal-echoes.md §Cross-Substrate Sensory Resonances`." Forces the question to be answered, doesn't block.
- [x] **5f — Redundancy-with-adjacent-text NOTE** — implemented as check class **Q**. Heuristic: if a paragraph repeats specific information given in the immediately preceding paragraph (especially across a system message → flashback boundary, e.g., the Game says "your mother made couscous" and the next paragraph describes that exact couscous), flag NOTE for review — the writer may want to defer / vary the second beat to avoid the reader feeling told twice.

---

**Phase 3 totals:** 5 milestones, all in this skill repo. Phase 3 produces a check (sniff) and rules (chapter-writer, coherence-check) that surface project-content gaps; the gaps themselves go to each book project's DEVPLAN.

**Out of scope:** the smell-test does NOT auto-fix worldbuilding gaps — it just surfaces them. The user/agent triages.

---

## Phase 4 — Context-symmetry Guardrails (2026-04-30) — IDD

Surfaced from the ground-truth project's Phase 113 M4 / Phase 114 investigation. Pre-Phase-114, B1 Ch.01 carried 28 files in `**context:**`; manual audit showed only 16 were genuinely beat-referenced, 12 were orphan accumulation, and 3 newly-canonical files (post-Phase-112) were absent. The previous mitigation was a malformed rule on Ch.01 only ("MAX 3 files actively drawn from in prose"); abandoned in Phase 114 as a band-aid for bloat.

This phase encodes the symmetry principle skill-side so future drift is caught at write-time and at coherence-time, not via manual audit:

- **Symmetry rule (project-side, in each book's outline.md §Context Tags):** every file in `**context:**` has at least one beat that references it; every beat that needs a file lists that file. When beats mutate, `**context:**` mutates.
- **Skill-side enforcement (this phase):** the chapter-writer agent checks symmetry before drafting; the coherence-check agent flags asymmetries on existing outlines as WARNING.

**Execution mode:** IDD (instruction-file deliverables, same justification as Phase 3 §32 — no test runner; grep-tests over markdown rules would be cargo-cult).

### M1: chapter-writer pre-draft Context Symmetry Check ✅

**File:** `instructions/chapter-writer.md` (REVISIONE — append a new Pre-Drafting Context Symmetry Check section after the existing Pre-Drafting Anchor Checks).

- [x] **1a — Beat-side scan (missing files).** Before drafting, the agent parses the chapter outline beats up to the next chapter header, extracting:
  - Explicit references: every `→ see <path>` and every `<path>` mentioned by name.
  - Implicit references: every named character (cross-ref `characters/**.md`), every named location (cross-ref `level-N-*/locations*.md` or `level-0-reality/architecture.md`), every named system / mechanism / technical anchor (cross-ref `world/**.md`).
  Compares the union against the chapter's `**context:**` list (excluding always-loaded set declared in the outline header). Files referenced in beats but missing from `**context:**` → STOP. Output the list of missing files and request user confirmation to add (or auto-add if user has pre-authorized).
- [x] **1b — Context-side scan (orphan files).** For every file in `**context:**` (excluding always-loaded), the agent verifies at least one beat reference exists per 1a. Files with no beat reference → flag as "orphan candidate" in pre-draft summary. NOT blocking — orphans are advisory, since some files may be load-bearing for consistency-only checks (in which case the agent should propose moving them to always-loaded). User confirms before drafting proceeds.
- [x] **1c — Post-draft audit.** After drafting, the agent generates `chapters/book-N/chNN-context-audit.md` (gitignored, ephemeral): each file in `**context:**` mapped to the beat / line-range where it was actually used in prose, plus any file used in prose but not in `**context:**`. Compares against the planned context list and outputs a one-line drift summary: `context drift: -<file> (planned, unused), +<file> (used, unplanned)`. Drift entries feed back into the symmetry check for the next chapter.
- [x] **1d — Always-loaded set awareness.** The agent loads the outline header's always-loaded reference paragraph (typically `world/technology-comparison.md`, `world/temporal-echoes.md`, `world/tones.md`, foreground character files) and excludes those from both the "missing" and "orphan" checks. Always-loaded references are out of scope for per-chapter symmetry.

### M2: coherence-check — context-symmetry as WARNING (R + S) ✅

**File:** `instructions/coherence-check.md` (REVISIONE — append two new check classes after existing Q Redundancy-with-adjacent-text NOTE).

Implementation note: the original DEVPLAN proposed numeric class names (5g/5h), but Phase 3 M5 had already shipped using letter classes (L–Q). To stay consistent with the in-file convention, the new classes are **R** (orphan WARNING) and **S** (missing-context WARNING).

- [x] **R — Context-list orphan WARNING.** For every chapter in the relevant outline, parse `**context:**` and check that each listed file (excluding always-loaded set declared in the outline header) has at least one beat reference (explicit `→ see` OR a named entity that semantically requires the file's content). Files with zero references → WARNING.
- [x] **S — Missing-context WARNING.** For every explicit `→ see <path>` reference and every named character / location / system / technical anchor in beats, verify the corresponding canonical file is in the chapter's `**context:**` (or in always-loaded). Missing → WARNING.
- [x] Both checks are WARNING-level (not BLOCKING) because: (i) the heuristic for "named entity → canonical file" is fuzzy and false positives are non-trivial; (ii) project-side review is the right place to adjudicate. BLOCKING would over-fire.

### M3: Outline-mutation hook in 4d ✅

**File:** `instructions/chapter-writer.md` (REVISIONE — extend existing Phase 3 M4 4d Outline-to-chapter coverage contract).

- [x] **4d.iv — Context-list update on outline mutation.** When the writer cuts/splits/reorders scenes per 4d (i)-(iii), the writer ALSO updates the affected chapter's `**context:**` field — removing files that lose their justifying beat (per 2.6.b), adding files newly required (per 2.6.a). The outline-deviation entry must include a `Context: -<file>, +<file>` line summarizing the diff so the change is auditable in `outline-deviation.md`.
- [x] If a beat moves to a different chapter (Phase 113 example: Ch.01 Beat 2a body-maintenance moved to Ch.04), the source chapter loses the corresponding files (e.g., `medicine-and-body.md`) and the destination chapter gains them. Both `**context:**` fields update; both diffs go to `outline-deviation.md`.

### M4: SKILL.md routing + dispatcher hint ✅

**File:** `SKILL.md` (REVISIONE — small touch).

- [x] Add a one-line note in the Pipeline section pointing at chapter-writer Step 2.6 + coherence-check classes R/S.
- [x] No new subcommand — symmetry checks live inside existing chapter-writer + coherence-check, not as a standalone command.

---

**Phase 4 totals:** 4 milestones, all instruction-file edits. No new tooling. No new subcommand. Tightens the existing chapter-writer + coherence-check + revise pipeline so context-list drift is caught at the two natural enforcement points: write-time (chapter-writer pre-check, blocking on missing files) and audit-time (coherence-check, WARNING on orphans + gaps).

**Out of scope:** auto-fixing the trilogy's existing context-list drift — that's project-side work in `ground-truth/DEVPLAN.md` Phase 114 M3 (sub-agent-driven trilogy audit, applied per-chapter).

---

## Phase 5 — uv-managed export scripts (2026-05-01) — IN PROGRESS

Phase 1 (PDF) shipped expecting `weasyprint` + `markdown` to be on the system Python; Phase 2 (EPUB) added `ebooklib` + `pyyaml`. On modern Linux distros (PEP 668), `pip install --user` is blocked without `--break-system-packages`, and the install.sh dependency-check just emits a warning and leaves the user to figure it out. Phase 2 M4 (smoke test) has been blocked on this since 2026-04-29.

This phase migrates both export scripts to **PEP 723 inline script metadata** with a `uv run --script` shebang. Each script declares its own dependencies in a header block; `uv` resolves them into an ephemeral cached venv on first run and reuses it on subsequent runs. No persistent venv to manage, no machine-specific paths, no pip-vs-system-python contention. install.sh's dependency check collapses to a single `command -v uv` probe.

### M1: `scripts/build_pdf.py` — PEP 723 header + uv shebang ✅

**File:** `scripts/build_pdf.py` (REVISIONE — first 10 lines).

- [x] Replace shebang `#!/usr/bin/env python3` with `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script`.
- [x] Insert PEP 723 metadata block immediately after shebang:
  ```python
  # /// script
  # requires-python = ">=3.11"
  # dependencies = [
  #     "markdown",
  #     "weasyprint>=60",
  # ]
  # ///
  ```
- [x] No code changes. Imports stay as-is.

### M2: `scripts/build_epub.py` — PEP 723 header + uv shebang ✅

**File:** `scripts/build_epub.py` (REVISIONE — first 10 lines).

- [x] Replace shebang `#!/usr/bin/env python3` with `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script`.
- [x] Insert PEP 723 metadata block:
  ```python
  # /// script
  # requires-python = ">=3.11"
  # dependencies = [
  #     "markdown",
  #     "ebooklib",
  #     "pyyaml",
  # ]
  # ///
  ```
- [x] Promote `pyyaml` from optional (`try: import yaml`) to required — it's <100 KB and the conditional-import logic adds noise. Update the body if it has a try/except guard.

### M3: `install.sh` — collapse dependency checks to `uv` probe ✅

**File:** `install.sh` (REVISIONE — replace the MISSING[] block).

- [x] Drop the per-module `python3 -c "import X"` checks for `markdown`, `weasyprint`, `ebooklib`, `pyyaml`.
- [x] Replace with: `command -v uv >/dev/null 2>&1 || MISSING+=("uv (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) — needed for /book pdf and /book epub")`.
- [x] Keep the `python3` check (still needed as fallback / sanity).
- [x] Update the warning text: "Only /book pdf and /book epub need uv; deps are auto-resolved at first run."

### M4: `instructions/pdf.md` + `instructions/epub.md` — drop `python3` prefix ✅

**Files:** `instructions/pdf.md`, `instructions/epub.md` (REVISIONE — invocation lines).

- [x] Replace `python3 ~/.claude/skills/book/scripts/build_pdf.py <args>` with `~/.claude/skills/book/scripts/build_pdf.py <args>` (script self-bootstraps via uv shebang).
- [x] Same for `build_epub.py`.
- [x] Add a one-line note: "First invocation triggers uv to resolve dependencies (cached after); subsequent runs are instant."

### M5: Smoke tests (closes Phase 2 M4) ✅

**Targets:** synthetic minimal markdown (book-1 has no drafted chapters yet — Ch.01 reset by Phase 112 M1).

- [x] Built temp test book at `/tmp/tmp.*/book-1/` with `outline.md` + `ch01.md` (~150 words).
- [x] PDF single-chapter test: `~/.claude/skills/book/scripts/build_pdf.py /tmp/.../book-1 --chapter ch01` → `wrote .../pdf/ch01.pdf`. uv resolved 14 packages on first run. ✅
- [x] EPUB single-chapter: surfaced **two pre-existing Phase 2 bugs** (see M6). Fix landed in M6, then re-tested → `wrote .../epub/ch01.epub` (1965 bytes, 7 internal files: mimetype + container.xml + content.opf + style.css + ch01.xhtml + toc.ncx + nav.xhtml). ✅
- [x] EPUB whole-book: `~/.claude/skills/book/scripts/build_epub.py /tmp/.../book-1` → `wrote .../epub/book-1.epub`. ✅
- [x] uv cache reuse verified — second invocation does not re-download (env reused at `~/.cache/uv/environments-v2/`).
- [x] **Closes Phase 2 M4** (smoke test deferred since 2026-04-29 because of `ebooklib` PEP 668 install issue, now solved by uv self-bootstrap).

### M6: Fix EpubNav empty-content + chapter-content-as-str bugs (closes Phase 2 M4 properly) ✅

**File:** `scripts/build_epub.py` (REVISIONE).

Surfaced by the M5 smoke test — these are **pre-existing Phase 2 bugs** that nobody had ever triggered because nobody had ever run the script (M4 deferred since 2026-04-29).

**Bug 1 — `EpubNav()` empty content.** ebooklib's auto-nav-gen runs at `write()` time, but the `_get_nav` call inside `_write_items` happens before that auto-gen populates content. Modern lxml rejects an empty document body with `lxml.etree.ParserError: Document is empty`. The error was non-fatal (epub still got written), but the resulting nav was missing.

**Bug 2 — `chap.content` set as `str`.** `EpubHtml.content` requires `bytes`. When given a `str`, ebooklib wrote a 0-byte chapter file. Same for the CSS item.

- [x] **Fix 1:** Add `make_nav(items, title) -> epub.EpubNav` helper that builds explicit nav XHTML with TOC ol/li, sets `nav.content` as bytes. Replace `book.add_item(epub.EpubNav())` (both single-chapter and whole-book code paths) with `book.add_item(make_nav([chap], title))` / `make_nav(items, title)`.
- [x] **Fix 2:** Add `.encode("utf-8")` to `chap.content` assignment in `make_chapter_item`. Switch CSS load from `read_text(encoding="utf-8")` to `read_bytes()`.
- [x] Re-tested — both single-chapter and whole-book modes now emit valid EPUBs with populated chapter XHTML and nav.

---

**Phase 5 totals:** 6 milestones. Migrates Phase 1 + Phase 2 scripts to PEP 723 / uv self-bootstrap; surfaces and fixes two pre-existing EPUB bugs along the way. Removes the install.sh PEP 668 footgun. Closes Phase 2 M4 (smoke test, blocked since 2026-04-29).

**Out of scope:** generic uv migration of any future Python tooling — handle case-by-case as scripts are added. The pattern (PEP 723 + `uv run --script` shebang) is now the project's default for standalone Python scripts in this skill.

---

## Phase 6 — Verification-block scope rule (2026-05-06)

Surfaced by ground-truth project DEVPLAN: 17 stale "Pending milestones from Phases X/Y/Z still require application" meta-statements + 13 stale "Apply Phase NN via `/book fix <scope>` — pending" operational items, all referencing phases that had been applied + re-verified clean by subsequent coherence cycles. Root cause: `coherence-check.md` / `continuity-check.md` Step 4 specify the executable milestone template but not the `### Verification & next steps` block, so the model invents that block per phase and propagates prior-phase status forward; `/book fix` closes only `[ ]` checkboxes, never the matching plain-bullet `— pending` operational items.

Fix is two complementary doctrine additions: (a) constrain the verification block to per-phase scope (no transitive forward-looking, no prior-phase restatement), (b) extend `/book fix` to close operational items that name its just-completed invocation.

- [x] **M1**: Add `## Verification & next-steps blocks` section to `instructions/milestone-format.md` codifying three rules — per-phase scope only, no transitive forward-looking unblock claims, `/book fix` closes matching operational items. ✅
- [x] **M2**: In `instructions/coherence-check.md` §4 "Rules for the corrections devplan", add a bullet cross-linking to `instructions/milestone-format.md` §Verification & next-steps blocks. ✅
- [x] **M3**: In `instructions/continuity-check.md` §4 "Write Corrections", add the same cross-link. ✅
- [x] **M4**: In `instructions/fix.md` §2 "Apply Each Milestone", add `Step E — Close Matching Operational Items` describing the scan-and-update logic (match `/book fix <scope>` references in DEVPLAN, update `— pending` → `— done YYYY-MM-DD`). ✅
- [x] **M5**: Reinstall — `cd ~/Documents/software/skills/book && ./install.sh --force`. ✅ (deployed to `~/.claude/skills/book` 2026-05-06)

**Out of scope:** retroactive cleanup of the 30 already-stale markers in the ground-truth project's DEVPLAN. Those will close on the next `/book fix` invocation that touches a phase referenced by them, OR via a one-shot chirurgical edit (separate ask).

## Phase 7 — Operational closure across pre-writing commands (2026-05-06)

Surfaced from ground-truth DEVPLAN audit after Phase 6 deployment: `/book fix all` §2.5 closed 20 of 48 residual `— pending` items; 28 remained. Two doctrine gaps:

1. Operational items pointing to non-`/book fix` pre-writing commands (`/book coherence`, `/book continuity`, `/book compact`) have no consumer that closes them — Phase 6 §2.5 deferred to "their own consumers" but those consumers don't exist.
2. Operational items pointing to `/book write` and drafting-unblock state observations leak writing-phase content into the pre-writing ledger. Pre-writing convergence (worldbuilding / coherence-clean) is the prior phase; drafting is a separate ledger and its readiness statements belong in chapter-level state docs, not phase ledgers.

Fix is symmetric across pre-writing commands plus a doctrine ban on write-phase refs.

**Convergence trace.** Post-Phase-7 + post-M6 sweep, `run-coherence-cycle.sh` leaves the ledger clean across cycles:

| Step in cycle | What it closes | New refs it may write |
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|
| `/book coherence <scope>` (0/0/0) | §4.5: own pending refs | only allowed pre-writing refs |
| `/book fix <scope>` | §2.5: own pending refs (+ widened sweep, M5) | n/a — fix doesn't add operational items |
| `/book revise <scope>` (no chapters) | n/a | n/a — no-op until drafting starts |
| `/book continuity X Y` (0/0/0) | §4.5: own pending refs | only allowed pre-writing refs |
| `/book compact <scope>` | §4.5: own pending refs (idempotent) | n/a |

Invariants at convergence (stable across cycles):
- `grep -c "^- \[ \]" DEVPLAN.md == 0` (existing — checkbox count)
- `grep -c "— pending$" DEVPLAN.md == 0` (new — operational-item count)

The cycle script's `count_unresolved_global` already enforces invariant 1. Phase 7 makes invariant 2 self-maintaining.

- [x] **M1**: `instructions/milestone-format.md` §Verification & next-steps blocks — extend rule 2 with explicit allow/ban list. **Allowed** pre-writing refs in operational blocks: `/book fix`, `/book coherence`, `/book continuity`, `/book compact`. **Banned** writing-phase refs: `/book write`, `/book chapter`, `/book sniff`, `/book review`, `/book proofread`, `/book revise` — these belong to a separate writing-phase ledger (chapter-level files: `chapters/<book>/state.md`, SMELL.md, REVIEW.md, PROOFREAD.md). Drafting-unblock state observations ("B1 drafting unblocked once Phase X closes") route to `chapters/<book>/state.md` §Open Threads, never phase ledgers — they are transitive-forward-looking per existing rule 2 and decay silently. Orchestration script refs (`./run-coherence-cycle.sh ...`) are circular in phase ledgers (the script generated the phase) — discouraged; if genuinely needed, use plain bullet without `— pending` (informational, not actionable).
- [x] **M2**: `instructions/coherence-check.md` — add §4.5 "Close Matching Operational Items" mirroring fix.md §2.5. Trigger: invocation produces 0 BLOCKING / 0 WARNING / 0 NOTE actionable findings (the verification semantic). Action: scan DEVPLAN for plain-bullet items matching `/book coherence <scope>` or `Re-run .*/book coherence <scope>` with status `— pending`, update to `— done YYYY-MM-DD`. Scope-aware (matches `all` against per-book scopes per the union rule).
- [x] **M3**: `instructions/continuity-check.md` — same §4.5 pattern for `/book continuity <from> <to>` (or `/book continuity X Y`). Trigger same: 0/0/0 actionable.
- [x] **M4**: `instructions/compact.md` — same §4.5 for `/book compact <scope>`. Trigger: every invocation (compact is idempotent — re-running on a converged state confirms convergence; a fresh run is valid evidence the named compact was performed).
- [x] **M5**: `instructions/fix.md` §2.5 — defensive widen. After the existing pattern matches, if the invocation completes with DEVPLAN at zero unchecked `[ ]`, also sweep `— pending` items in fully-`[x]`-closed phases whose action describes pre-writing work (fix/coherence/continuity/compact/cycle script). Catches edge-case phrasings the literal patterns miss (e.g., `M1 closes via /book fix book-2`, `After M1 applies, ...`). Defensive — should not fire on the happy path post-M1+M6, but provides a safety net.
- [x] **M6**: One-time chirurgical sweep of the 28 residuals in `~/Documents/books/ground-truth/DEVPLAN.md`. Rationale: all 28 reference banned commands per M1 OR describe verifiably-completed actions (commit history + Phase 181 convergence trace). Update each `— pending` → `— done 2026-05-06`. Lines: 247–250, 291, 292, 385, 386, 441, 442, 477, 512, 547, 578, 614, 645, 682, 723, 761, 762, 796, 848, 880, 925, 964, 1003, 1033, 1082.
- [x] **M7**: Reinstall (`cd ~/Documents/software/skills/book && ./install.sh --force`) + commit skill repo + commit project DEVPLAN sweep.

**Out of scope:** writing-phase ledger architecture (separate file? separate top-level section in DEVPLAN.md?). For now, writing-phase state lives in chapter-level files. If a recurring pattern emerges where writing needs its own DEVPLAN section, surface as Phase 8.

## Phase 8 — External-world factual-claim guardrails (2026-05-07)

> **Execution mode:** IDD fallback expected, per Phase 3 precedent. Deliverables are markdown LLM-instruction edits; grep-tests would be cargo-cult per `~/.claude/skills/devplan/TDD.md` §1 ("if you cannot articulate a testable user-visible behavior, fall back to IDD").

Surfaced from B1 Ch.01 audit (ground-truth project, 2026-05-07). The chapter passed the writer's 9 verification passes and would have passed coherence-check (canon-internal). Manual reader audit caught four real errors: a hardware-connector direction inverted (HDMI-to-VGA ↔ VGA-to-HDMI), a real-world street name placed in the wrong arrondissement, a French toponym with broken article-preposition contraction (`Rue de Petit Puits` for `Rue du Petit Puits`), and an intra-scene continuity slip on a wrapping cloth.

Three of the four are **assertions about facts external to the project's canon** — real geography, real technology, foreign-language grammar of proper nouns. The skill canonizes its own world meticulously but assumes the writer agent's internal model is reliable for facts not in the canon files. In practice the writer agent confidently produces plausible-sounding-but-wrong specifics in this class. The fourth (cloth) is intra-scene continuity, already covered by sniff §9 — a calibration matter, not a structural gap.

Phase 8 adds three structural guardrails, one per stage of the cycle (prevention, detection, enforcement):

1. **Prevent at draft.** chapter-writer.md self-edit gets an "External-world claim discipline" check (#16).
2. **Detect at sniff.** sniff.md §5 gets an explicit "Real-world factual claim" sub-rubric.
3. **Enforce at proofread.** proof-reader.md P4 gets a foreign-language proper-noun grammar rule.

Generic across the trilogy. Not patching the four specific Ch.01 incidents — patching the class.

**Out of scope (separate trilogy-side concern):** `run-write-cycle.sh` line 574 — flip `needs_thinking` from `0` to `1` for the PROOFREAD step so selective `--ultrathink` flows into proofread. The script lives in the trilogy project, not the skill repo. Will be applied separately project-side after Phase 8 ships.

### M1: chapter-writer.md self-edit — add #16 "External-world claim discipline"

**File:** `instructions/chapter-writer.md` §Step 3.5 Self-Edit Pass (REVISIONE — append item 16).

Insert a 16th item in the numbered self-edit checklist, in the same format as items 1-15. Content: for every concrete real-world assertion in the draft (real place name, technical specification, foreign-language grammar of a proper noun, real physics/biology/medicine/law/finance, real brand or date or currency), the writer agent must classify the assertion as one of:

- **(a) Project canon supports it** — the writer can cite a canonical file (e.g., `world/level-0-reality/...`, `consumer-anchors.md`, etc.). Keep.
- **(b) High-confidence real-world fact** — the writer is confident this is correct external knowledge. Keep, but the assertion is now declared as load-bearing on real-world fact.
- **(c) Cannot verify** — abstract or cut. False precision is more costly than vagueness.

Default rule: when in doubt, cut the specificity. A scene rendered with a generic "the cable" is worth more than a scene rendered with a specific cable model that is wrong.

The check explicitly cross-references sniff.md §5 (where the post-draft detection layer lives). The self-edit is the prevention layer; sniff is the safety net.

- [x] Append item 16 to the numbered list at lines 325-349, matching the existing item format (one short bold lead-in clause, then the rule). ✅
- [x] Item title: **External-world claim discipline (see `sniff.md` §5).** ✅
- [x] Body: 5 lines. Cover the (a)/(b)/(c) classification + the default-to-cut bias + cross-link to sniff §5. ✅
- [x] No examples that name specific Ch.01 incidents (HDMI/VGA, Marseille, etc.) — keep the rule generic across the trilogy. ✅

### M2: sniff.md §5 — explicit "Real-world factual claim" sub-rubric

**File:** `instructions/sniff.md` §5 (REVISIONE — restructure).

Today §5 ("Domain plausibility") names a few expert-reader personas (economist, engineer, doctor, native of the city/region) as a single short paragraph. Restructure §5 into a layered rubric: (a) keep the existing expert-reader framing as the lead, (b) add an explicit sub-rubric "Real-world factual claim audit" that operationalizes it.

The sub-rubric: for every concrete assertion that depends on knowledge external to the project's canon files, the sniff agent classifies into:

- **Anchored in canon** — cite the file. Pass.
- **Real-world verifiable, high confidence** — declare. Pass.
- **Cannot verify / makes friction** — flag. Classification: INLINE if prose-fixable, ANCHOR-NEEDED if the project should canonicalize an in-world override, ACCEPT only with explicit outline evidence.

Categories the agent must scan (generic, not chapter-specific):

- Real-world places: streets, neighborhoods, landmarks, country/city facts, geography, climate facts.
- Specific technology: model numbers, connector types, version numbers, hardware compatibility, software stacks, period plausibility (does this exist at the implied year? is it in actual use at that year? is the chain physically realizable?).
- Foreign-language grammar in proper nouns: when the text names a French / Italian / Spanish / etc. proper noun, the source-language grammar applies (article-preposition contractions, gender agreement, etc.).
- Real-world physics, biology, medicine, law, finance.
- Real brand names, dates, currencies, units.

Calibration note (load-bearing): **specific-sounding details fail at higher rates than their tone suggests.** A writer agent producing "model VGA-to-HDMI converter cable" is not stating a verified fact; it's selecting a plausible-sounding token to add texture. Sniff must treat highly-specific technical assertions with more suspicion than general descriptive ones, because the failure mode is "plausibly worded → plausibly wrong."

- [x] Restructure §5 to have a lead paragraph (existing expert-reader framing, kept) + a sub-rubric "Real-world factual claim audit" with the three-way classification. ✅
- [x] List the 5 categories generically (no Ch.01-specific examples). ✅ (places, technology, foreign-language grammar, physics/biology/medicine/law/finance, brands/dates/currencies/units)
- [x] Add the calibration note about tone-vs-correctness. ✅
- [x] Cross-link forward to §9 (continuity within chapter) and back to chapter-writer.md §3.5 #16 (the prevention layer). ✅

### M3: proof-reader.md P4 — foreign-language proper-noun grammar

**File:** `instructions/proof-reader.md` P4 (REVISIONE — append sub-rule).

Today P4 ("Spelling & Proper Nouns") lists project-canonical proper nouns and flags variants. Add a generic sub-rule: foreign-language proper nouns must respect source-language grammar.

Rule: for proper nouns from non-English source languages — toponyms, institution names, product names — the source-language grammar is normative. The most common slip a model anglophone makes is the article-preposition contraction:

- French: `de + le → du`, `de + les → des`, `à + le → au`, `à + les → aux`. So `Rue de + le Petit Puits → Rue du Petit Puits`.
- Italian: `di + il → del`, `di + lo → dello`, `di + la → della`, `a + il → al`, etc. So `Via di + il Foro → Via del Foro`.
- Spanish: `de + el → del`, `a + el → al`. So `Calle de + el Sol → Calle del Sol`.
- German: noun-gender + case agreement on articles in compound place names.

Also generic: gender agreement, plural forms, accent marks (é, è, à, ñ, ü) must be present where the source language requires them.

The rule applies even when the proper noun is rendered in CAPS (e.g., on an in-world terminal) or surrounded by English-language narration. Capitalization does not exempt the noun from its source-language grammar.

- [x] Append a sub-rule under P4 with the rule + the four example forms (FR / IT / ES + DE gender-case agreement). Generic, not Ch.01-specific. ✅
- [x] Note the in-CAPS / in-English-context exemption-is-not-allowed clause. ✅
- [x] One-line example each, no full case studies. ✅

### M4: Reinstall + commit + push

- [x] `cd ~/Documents/software/skills/book && ./install.sh --force` — deploy to `~/.claude/skills/book/`. ✅ (deployed 2026-05-07; verified via `grep -c "External-world claim discipline"` etc. on the installed copy)
- [x] `git add` modified instruction files + DEVPLAN.md, commit with message describing Phase 8 scope. ✅ (split per-milestone: M1 a887fd3, M2 14f8e88, M3 2ec2879)
- [x] `git push` to skill repo origin. ✅ (pushed after each milestone)

---

**Phase 8 totals:** 4 milestones (3 doctrine + 1 deploy). Adds prevention/detection/enforcement guardrails for one class of failure: external-world factual assertions. Generic across the trilogy. Out of scope: trilogy-side `run-write-cycle.sh` line 574 flip (separate, applied project-side after Phase 8 ships).

## Phase 9 — Reviewer flagging discipline: signal-not-noise (2026-05-08)

> **Execution mode:** IDD fallback per Phase 3 / Phase 8 precedent — markdown LLM-instruction edits, no test runner. The "test" of Phase 9 is the next chapter's REVIEW/SMELL output: under the new doctrine, fewer SAFE-CUT findings, some TRADE-OFF findings explicitly surfaced for user decision, and SAFE-KEEP entries acknowledged-but-not-actioned.

Surfaced from B1 Ch.01 cycle 1-3 polish run on the trilogy project (commits `4413287` → `2444c35` → `d7a857b`, 2026-05-08). Three cycles of SNIFF + REVIEW + PROOFREAD + REVISE removed four real factual bugs (HDMI/VGA direction, Marseille streets, French grammar, scarf continuity) — Phase 8 guardrails worked as designed. But the same three cycles also smoothed away the chapter's three sharpest beats: the iconic moka-pot opening, the Mariette-paid-the-contractor backstory paragraph, and the *"He did not look up"* close on the curb fall. Each cut was technically defensible per a style rule (compressed opening is a stative pattern; the backstory paragraph was an em-dash gloss; the line was an aphoristic close). Each cut weakened the chapter.

The cycle is good at finding errors. It's less good at distinguishing problem from voice. The Reviewer's burden of proof is on the wrong foot: today, a rule-violation is automatic flag → REVISE auto-applies. Phase 9 flips it: a rule-violation is flagged ONLY IF removing it improves the chapter; the reviewer must articulate the improvement. If the reviewer can't articulate, no flag. When the reviewer does flag and the affected line is voice-floor (compression, body-first, deliberate violation, named in writing-notes as intentional), classification is TRADE-OFF — surfaced for user decision, NOT auto-applied.

This is *not* a relaxation of standards. It's a higher standard: the Reviewer must *earn* each flag by stating the loss-vs-gain explicitly, not by pattern-matching against rule lists.

Three concrete additions across reviewer/sniff/revise:

1. **Voice-Floor Pass at the start of REVIEW and SNIFF** — first read identifies the chapter's load-bearing beats (compression, surprise, body-first close, deliberate stylization). Marked as VOICE-FLOOR for the second pass.
2. **Three-tier classification** — every flag is classified as SAFE-CUT (rule-violation, removal improves chapter, REVISE auto-applies), TRADE-OFF (rule-violation OR voice-floor candidate, removal has named cost AND named benefit, REVISE does NOT auto-apply, surfaces in `*-PENDING.md`), or SAFE-KEEP (rule-violation but the line is earning its keep — informational, no action).
3. **Pre-step archive** — at the start of each SNIFF/REVIEW/PROOFREAD step, if the existing finding-file is present, rename it to `archive/<NAME>-<timestamp>-<chapter>.md` before writing the new one. Forensic history of polish decisions across cycles.

Plus one Reviewer addition that uses character canon as a positive constraint:

4. **Voice-Signature positive check** — the Reviewer loads `voice-samples.md`, looks for a `§Voice Signature` paragraph per character (4-6 qualities to preserve, e.g. "Noah: short declarative sentences after long compressed ones; ends scenes on absence not summary; never explains his own emotions"), and uses it as a positive checklist. A fix that erodes a Voice-Signature quality is automatic TRADE-OFF, never SAFE-CUT.

Out of scope (project-side, separate concern): authoring `§Voice Signature` paragraphs in the trilogy's `characters/notes/voice-samples.md`. Phase 9 specifies the format and tells the Reviewer how to use it. If the section is missing, the Reviewer notes the gap as a soft warning and falls back to style-rule-only mode (current behavior). That keeps the skill self-consistent on projects that haven't authored signatures yet.

### M1: Reviewer voice-floor pass + three-tier classification + raised flagging bar

**File:** `instructions/reviewer.md` (REVISIONE).

- [x] Insert new step 2.5 (between current "Check Existing Reviews" and "Analyze — 8 Dimensions"): `Voice-Floor First Pass`. Body: read each chapter once before applying rule scans. Identify 3-7 voice-floor beats per chapter — sentences/paragraphs that are doing the heaviest work via compression, surprise, body-first cadence, deliberate violation of style rule for tonal effect, or matching a named technique in `writing-notes.md`. List them in working memory before the rule scan.
- [x] Modify step 3 ("Analyze — 8 Dimensions"): each finding the Reviewer would historically flag must now be tested against three questions before being added to REVIEW.md: (1) does removing this line improve the chapter? articulate the gain in one sentence. (2) what is lost? articulate the loss in one sentence. (3) is the line voice-floor (from step 2.5)? If yes, classification is TRADE-OFF regardless of (1)/(2). If no but (1) > (2), SAFE-CUT. If (1) ≤ (2) or (1) cannot be articulated, SAFE-KEEP.
- [x] Modify step 5 ("Output — The Report"): each entry now carries a Classification: line (SAFE-CUT / TRADE-OFF / SAFE-KEEP). TRADE-OFF entries include explicit `Loss:` and `Gain:` lines. SAFE-KEEP entries are listed in a separate "Acknowledged, no action" block.
- [x] Modify step 6 ("Write the Review Devplan"): only SAFE-CUT items become checkboxes in REVIEW.md. TRADE-OFF items go in a new `## Trade-Off Decisions Pending` section without checkboxes — REVISE will read but not auto-apply. SAFE-KEEP items in `## Acknowledged (No Action)` section.
- [x] Add a Calibration paragraph at the end of step 3: "Most rule-violations in a polished chapter are SAFE-KEEP, not SAFE-CUT. The Reviewer's job is signal, not coverage. If you cannot articulate a one-sentence improvement from removing a line, that line is not a finding."

### M2: Sniff three-tier classification

**File:** `instructions/sniff.md` (REVISIONE).

- [x] In §"The nine objection categories", add a preamble paragraph: each objection must pass the same three-question test as the Reviewer (improvement articulable? loss articulable? voice-floor? → SAFE-CUT / TRADE-OFF / SAFE-KEEP). The existing INLINE/ANCHOR-NEEDED/ACCEPT classification is orthogonal — applies to canon-vs-prose routing, not to flagging discipline.
- [x] In §"Output format — SMELL.md", augment the entry template to include a `Classification: SAFE-CUT | TRADE-OFF | SAFE-KEEP` line alongside the existing `Classification:` (which is INLINE/ANCHOR-NEEDED/ACCEPT). Clarify these are two distinct dimensions: the routing dimension (INLINE/etc) and the flagging-discipline dimension (SAFE-CUT/etc).
- [x] Add Calibration: "An objection that satisfies all nine categories but doesn't improve the chapter when fixed is still SAFE-KEEP. Specificity-feels-wrong is not the same as specificity-actually-wrong-and-fixing-it-helps."

### M3: Revise handles TRADE-OFF — does not auto-apply

**File:** `instructions/revise.md` (REVISIONE).

- [x] In the load-list section, add: read REVIEW.md and SMELL.md TRADE-OFF blocks. These are NOT auto-applied.
- [x] After SAFE-CUT items are applied, write `chapters/<book>/REVIEW-PENDING.md` and `chapters/<book>/SMELL-PENDING.md` containing the TRADE-OFF entries verbatim with `Status: pending — manual decision required` on each. These files are user-facing surfaces; the user reviews and applies (or marks `Status: ✓ Accepted (defer)`) manually before the next cycle.
- [x] In the revise summary output, include a `Trade-Off decisions surfaced: N` line and the path to the *-PENDING.md files. Surface specifically: how many entries pending, location, brief preview.
- [x] In the load-list section, also handle the case where *-PENDING.md exists from a prior cycle: items already present are NOT re-prompted; their state is preserved and re-emitted in the next cycle's *-PENDING.md so the user can accumulate decisions across cycles.

### M4: Pre-step archive for SMELL/REVIEW/PROOFREAD

**Files:** `instructions/sniff.md`, `instructions/reviewer.md`, `instructions/proof-reader.md` (each REVISIONE — small addition at start of process).

- [x] In each of the three skill files, at step 1 (or earliest pre-write step), add: "If `chapters/<book>/<NAME>.md` already exists from a prior cycle, rename it to `chapters/<book>/archive/<NAME>-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-<chapter>.md` (creating the archive subdir if needed) BEFORE writing the new one. This preserves per-cycle finding history without manual git archaeology."
- [x] Note: the archive lives under `chapters/<book>/archive/` (per-book, not per-project root) so each book's polish history is self-contained.

### M5: Reviewer Voice-Signature positive check

**Files:** `instructions/reviewer.md` (REVISIONE — positive constraint logic), `instructions/init.md` (light update — voice-samples.md format expectation).

- [x] In `reviewer.md` step 1 (Load Reference), expand voice-samples.md handling: read each character's `§Voice Signature` section if present (format: 4-6 bullet lines describing prose-level qualities to preserve, e.g. compression patterns, sentence rhythm signatures, what the character never does, deliberate stylistic moves). If a character's section is missing, note as a soft warning in the report and fall back to style-rule-only review for that character.
- [x] In `reviewer.md` step 3, add a "Voice-Signature drift check" sub-step before the 8 dimensions. For each chapter, scan: does the prose preserve the character's listed voice-signature qualities? If a candidate flag (from rule scan) would erode a voice-signature quality, classification becomes TRADE-OFF automatically — Reviewer cannot SAFE-CUT a fix that breaks character voice signature.
- [x] In `instructions/init.md` (light touch), add: "After voice-samples.md exists, each foreground character should have a `§Voice Signature` paragraph (4-6 prose-level qualities to preserve) — used by reviewer for positive constraint. If absent, reviewer falls back to style-rule-only mode."

### M6: Install + commit + push

- [x] `cd ~/Documents/software/skills/book && ./install.sh --force`
- [x] Stage all instruction edits + DEVPLAN.md, single commit with message describing Phase 9 scope.
- [x] `git push` to origin.

---

**Phase 9 totals:** 6 milestones (5 doctrine + 1 deploy). Raises the Reviewer/Sniff flagging bar from "rule-violation = flag" to "rule-violation that doesn't improve when fixed = SAFE-KEEP". Introduces TRADE-OFF as user-decision channel (not auto-applied). Adds per-cycle archive of finding-files. Adds Voice-Signature positive constraint with graceful fallback if missing.

**Out of scope (project-side, separate phase or done in next chapter prep):**
- Authoring `§Voice Signature` paragraphs in trilogy's `characters/notes/voice-samples.md` for Noah, Lena, Roe, etc. The skill ships the format expectation and the fallback; authoring the actual signatures is a one-time project-side write.
